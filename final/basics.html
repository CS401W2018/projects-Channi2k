            <h2>Valorant is a 5v5 tactical shooter by Riot Games where precision, teamwork, and strategy win the game. Each match is a race to 13 round wins, with one team attacking and the other defending. Every match is all about planning, reacting fast, and making smart choices with your team. You’ll want to learn your agent’s abilities and how to use them at the right time.</h2>

            <h2>Map knowledge is huge too, knowing common spots, angles, and how to rotate can give you a big advantage.
            Don't forget to communicate! Calling out enemy positions and working together can totally turn a round in your favor.
            And yeah, practice makes a difference, better aim, crosshair placement, and timing will all come with time.</h2>
