    <h2>Internet</h2>
    <p>a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols.</p>
    <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web—commonly referred to as WWW, W3, or the Web—is a system of interconnected public webpages accessible through the Internet. The Web is not the same as the Internet: the Web is one of many applications built on top of the Internet.</p>
    <h2>How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
    <p>The internet is a global network of computers that connects to other networks, while the web is a service that runs on the internet.</p>
    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p>ASCII and Unicode are two popular encoding schemes. ASCII encodes symbols, digits, letters, etc., whereas Unicode encodes special texts from different languages, letters, symbols, etc.</p>
    <h2>What is UTF-8</h2>
    <p>UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8) is a character encoding system that represents characters using one to four bytes. It's the most common character encoding on the World Wide Web. </p>
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <p>A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique address that points to a specific resource on the internet, such as a webpage or file.</p>
    <h2>Domain Name</h2>
    <p>A domain name is a unique, human-readable address used to access a website on the internet, </p>
    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a set of rules that govern how information is exchanged between a client and a web server. It's the foundation of the World Wide Web and the primary way that information is sent across the internet. </p>
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p>HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It's a secure version of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) that encrypts communication between a user's device and a website. </p>
    <h2>IP Address</h2>
    <p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is the unique identifying number assigned to every device connected to the internet. An IP address definition is a numeric label assigned to devices that use the internet to communicate.</p>
    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses, which browsers use to load internet pages. Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address, which is used by other devices to locate the device.</p>
    <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
    <p>A Recommendation W3C is interpreted by the industry and by the Web community, as being one synonym of normalization for the Web. Each Recommendation W3C is not more of the one than a steady specification developed by a Work group W3C (W3C Working Group) and reviewed by the members of the W3C.</p>
    <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p>HTML is the HyperText Markup Language, which is designed to create structured documents and provide for semantic meaning behind the documents. HTML5 is the next version of the HTML specification. XML is the Extensible Markup Language, which provides rules for creating, structuring, and encoding documents.</p>
