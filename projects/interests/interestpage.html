    <main><h2>DOTA 2</h2>
    <p class="red"> <span>Dota 2</span>  is my favorite game to play in PC. It is a modern multiplayer masterpiece. Every day, millions of players worldwide enter the battle as one of over a hundred Dota Heroes in a 5v5 team clash. Dota is the deepest multi-player action real-time strategy game ever made and there's always a new strategy or tactic to discover.</p>
    <p class="orange">For me personally, before Dota 2, I have tried Dota 1, and I loved the game statistics and its complexity so much since I was like 8 years old. I had to go to internet cafes to play the game with my friends or sometimes alone. 
    
    <p id="para1">So basically, Dota 2 is an upgraded, advanced, and better graphic quality of Dota 1. The developer of this game belongs to the Valve Corporation. Dota means Defense of the Ancient. Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game in which two teams of five players compete to destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the "Ancient" while also defending their own. It also needs Strategy, communication, teamwork, and reaction time.</p>

    <p class="blue"> <span>Relative links</span>  are mainly used to link to pages inside the same website since they are shorter, easier to manage, and will automatically update if the websites domain changes. In contrast, absolute links contain the entire web address.
