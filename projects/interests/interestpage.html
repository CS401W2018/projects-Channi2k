    <main><h2>DOTA 2</h2>
    <p>Dota 2 is my favorite game to play in PC. It is a modern multiplayer masterpiece. Every day, millions of players worldwide enter the battle as one of over a hundred Dota Heroes in a 5v5 team clash. Dota is the deepest multi-player action real-time strategy game ever made and there's always a new strategy or tactic to discover.</p>
    <p>For me personally, before Dota 2, I have tried Dota 1, and I loved the game statistics and its complexity so much since I was like 8 years old. I had to go to internet cafes to play the game with my friends or sometimes alone. So, basically, Dota 2 is an upgraded, advanced, and better graphic quality of Dota 1. The developer of this game belongs to the Valve Corporation. Dota means Defense of the Ancient. Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game in which two teams of five players compete to destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the "Ancient" while also defending their own. It also needs Strategy, communication, teamwork, and reaction time.</p>
