    <h2>Titanic</h2>
    <p>The <b>Titanic</b> was never actually described as ‘unsinkable’
        The Titanic was claimed by its builders to be ‘practically unsinkable’. It was a bold claim, but slightly less bold than the ‘unsinkable’ claims that movies have added to the story.
        
        It was at launch the largest object ever to move on the water but she was not designed to be the fastest <i>(Cunard’s Lusitania and Mauretania were always going to be faster).</i> Stories of the captain trying to make a speed record are without substance.</p>
