    <h4>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</h4>
    <p>Styles that are utilized within the HTML tag itself are known as inline styles. A page's header has embedded styles that are applied to the entire page. Each page of the website can link to an external style sheet, which is a distinct text file, to obtain its instructions.</p>
    
    <h4>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h4>
    
    <p>Because external styles are contained in a different file, the HTML file size is decreased and cached for quicker page loading.</p>
    <h4>What is a selector used for?</h4>
    <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</p>
