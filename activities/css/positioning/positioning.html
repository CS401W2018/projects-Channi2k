        <h1>Positioning</h1>
        <p>There are many characteristics or qualities of people as humans that can be irritating and annoying. Five of those things are at the top of my list, which include, chewing on ice, chewing with mouths open, obnoxiously loud talking, slow drivers, and smacking of gum. In my opinion, all five of these things are some of the most annoying things in the world, and Im sure you would agree with me as well.</p>

        <p>1. What is normal flow in HTML?</p>
        <p>Normal Flow is the way that block and inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout</p>
        <p>2. What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</p>
        <p>when an element floats, it is removed from the normal document flow, meaning subsequent elements might appear above it instead of below, so "clear" forces the next element to start below any floated elements, creating a proper layout. </p>
        <p>3. What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</p>   
        <p>In CSS, absolute, fixed, and relative positioning are ways to define how elements appear on a web page. </p>
        <p>4. How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</p>   
        <p>Just search it on google.</p>
        <p>5. Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</p>    
        <p>Probably in Youtube</p>
